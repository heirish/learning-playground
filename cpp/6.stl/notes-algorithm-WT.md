### Non-modifying Algoritms
count, min, max, compare, linear search, attribute
- most algorithms have a simple form and a generalized form
  
### Modifying Algorithms
- copy, move, transform, swap, fill, replace, remove:change the element value
- order-changing algorithm:reverse, rotate, permute, shuffle:they changes the order of elements in container, but not necessarily the elements themselves.

### Sorting Algorithms
- Sorting algorithm **requires random access iterators**: vector, deque, container array, native array
- list can NOT use this algorithm, but it has a .sort() member function
